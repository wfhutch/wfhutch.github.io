I am a married father of two living in Nashville, TN.  I am originally from Maine and haved lived in Nashville for the last 18 years.  I moved here primarily to escape those bitter New England winters but I do miss the coast in the summer.  Like half the population of this town I am a musician.  I love to play guitar and piano, but drums is the only instrument I will gig on.

I am currently attending Nashville Software School and will graduate on December 18, 2015 as a junior full-stack developer.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the rewarding, albeit challenging, process of learning different software technologies.  I also enjoy the whole process of problem solving and I am eager to continue to build up my developers toolbox.
