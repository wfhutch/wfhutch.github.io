I am a married father of two living in Nashville, TN.  I am originally from Maine and haved lived in Nashville for the last 18 years.  I moved here primarily to escape those bitter New England winters but I do miss the coast in the summer.  Like half the population of this town I am a musician.  I love to play guitar and piano, but drums is the only instrument I will gig on.

In December of 2015, I completed a six month full-time software bootcamp at Nashville Software School.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the rewarding, albeit challenging, process of learning different software technologies.  I also enjoy the whole process of problem solving and I am eager to begin my new career as a full-stack junior developer and continue to build up my developers toolbox!
