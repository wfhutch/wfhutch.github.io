I am a married father of two living in Nashville, TN.  I am originally from Maine and haved lived in Nashville for the last 19 years.  I moved here primarily to escape those bitter New England winters but I do miss the coast in the summer.  Like half the population of this town I am a musician.  I love to play guitar and piano, but drums is the only instrument I will gig on.

In December of 2015, I completed a six month full-time software bootcamp at Nashville Software School.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the rewarding, albeit challenging, process of learning different software technologies.  I also enjoy the whole process of problem solving and I am eager to begin my new career as a full-stack junior developer and continue to build up my developers toolbox!

On January 12, 2016 we had our demo day at Nashville Software School.  Clark Buckner was kind enough to come out and record all of the graduates.  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nashville-software-school/wayne-hutchinson?in=nashville-software-school/sets/cohort-10-night-cohort-1" target="_blank">Click here</a> for my interview with Clark.
